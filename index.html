          <p1><em>Solutions Architect<br><strong>Bullhorn, Inc.</strong></em></p1>
          <br><br>
          <p2>I am a Solutions Architect at <a href="http://www.bullhorn.com">Bullhorn, Inc.</a>. My work there focuses on providing our clients with "<em>an incredible customer experience</em>," while finding product solutions for their business needs. I have been with Bullhorn since August 5, 2019. Initially, I began with the company as a T1 ATS/CRM Technical Support Analyst for their native ATS/CRM product, but later became a <em>Subject Matter Expert</em> (SME) for several other Bullhorn-owned products. After mastering Tier 1 Support, I was promoted to Tier 2/Enterprise ATS/CRM support for the business' larger clients. I was then promoted to the Professional Services department as an Associate Solutions Architect, where I'm able to work with developers and engineers to offer custom solutions for our clients. While I really enjoy the work, I am currently expanding my technical knowledge into the area of programming, in the hopes I can one day secure a Solutions Architect or Software Engineer role within the organization.</p2>
